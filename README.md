# Estilo
Hi there! My name is Jo√£o Marcos, and this is my first website project developed in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as front-end developer. The website was created for a fictional store called EstiloUnico, where you can explore the different products and services offered by the store. As a beginner developer, I had the opportunity to learn and apply basic web development concepts such as creating pages with HTML, styling pages with CSS, and implementing interactivity with JavaScript. I hope you enjoy the website and feel free to leave feedback and suggestions for improvement!
